# Description

Adds a Build Step for scanning Docker images, local or hosted on
registries, for security vulnerabilities, using the API provided by
[Aqua Security](https://www.aquasec.com)

## Changelog:

#### **Version 3.2.9 (July 16, 2025)**

### Security Fixes
- **SECURITY-3542 / CVE-2025-53653**: Fixed tokens stored in plain text vulnerability
  - Local scanner tokens are now properly encrypted using Jenkins' Secret class
  - Tokens are no longer stored in plain text in job config.xml files
  - Added backward compatibility for existing configurations
  - Users with Item/Extended Read permission can no longer view tokens in plain text
  - Implemented migration approach that automatically encrypts tokens when jobs are loaded or executed
  - Added XML serialization control to ensure tokens are always saved in encrypted format

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue where the custom scanner path was not respected during local image scans

### Dependency Security Updates
- Updated `org.codehaus.plexus:plexus-utils` from 3.0.10 to 3.0.24 to fix:
  - **CVE-2017-1000487** (CRITICAL): Fixed command injection vulnerability in Commandline class
  - **CVE-2022-4244** (HIGH): Fixed directory traversal vulnerability
  - **CVE-2022-4245** (MEDIUM): Fixed XML External Entity (XXE) injection vulnerability
- Updated `org.jenkins-ci.plugins:structs` to version 1.24 for improved compatibility

### Technical Changes
- Changed `localToken` field from `String` to `Secret` type
- Added `readResolve()` method for configuration migration
- Added custom XML serialization method to ensure tokens are always encrypted
- Enhanced job execution to detect and migrate plaintext tokens
- Updated token handling in `ScannerExecuter` class
- Improved build process with containerized build support

### Migration Notes
- Existing configurations will be automatically migrated when jobs are loaded or executed
- No manual intervention required for existing installations
- Tokens will be re-encrypted on first job execution or configuration save
- Migration is logged in the Jenkins console for transparency
